# Model

## What is model?

- Like a map, a model represents something else
- A useful model has the **right level of detail** and represents only what is important for the task in hand
- Many things can be modelled: bridges, traffic flow, buildings, economic policy

### Benefit of model

- A model is quicker and easier to build than the real thing
- A model can be used in a simulation
- A model can evolve as we learn
- We can choose which details to include in a model
- A model can represent real or imaginary things from any domain

### Organization

- Organizations are human activity systems.
    - The situation is complex
    - Stakeholders have different views
    - We have to model requirements accurately, completely and unambiguously
    - The model must not prejudge the solution

## Diagram

- Abstract **shapes** are used to represent things or actions from the real world
- Diagrams follow rules or standards
- The standards make sure that different people will **interpret** the diagram in the same way

### UML diagrams

- UML diagrams consist of: 
    - icons 
    - two-dimensional symbols 
    - paths 
    - Strings

### Diagram VS Model

- A diagram illustrates <u>some aspect</u> of a system.
- A model provides a **complete view** of a system at a particular stage and from a particular perspective.
- A model may consist of a single diagram, but most consist of **many related diagrams** and supporting data and documentation.


### Example of model

- Requirements Model
    - complete view of requirements
    - may include other models, such as a Use Case Model
    - includes textual description as well as sets of diagrams

- Behavioural Model
    - shows how the system responds to events in the outside world and the passage of time
    - an initial model may just use Communication Diagrams
    - a later model will include Sequence Diagrams and State Machines

## Models in UML

- A system is the overall thing that is being modelled
- A subsystem is a part of a system consisting of related elements
- A model is an **abstraction of a system or subsystem** from a particular perspective
- A model is complete and consistent at the chosen level of abstraction

- Different models present **different views** of the system, for example:
    - use case view
    - design view
    - process view
    - implementation view
    - deployment view

- During the life of a project using an iterative life cycle, models **change** along the dimensions of:
    - abstraction—they become more concrete
    - formality—they become more formally specified
    - level of detail—additional detail is added as understanding improves
