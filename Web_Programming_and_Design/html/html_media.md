## Image

The HTML `<img>` tag is used to embed an **image** in a web page.

Images are not technically <u>inserted</u> into a web page; images are **linked** to web pages. The `<img>` tag creates a **holding space** for the referenced image.

The `<img> `tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does **not have a closing tag**.

The `<img>` tag has two required attributes:
- `src` - Specifies the **path(URL)** to the image
- `alt` - Specifies an **alternate text** for the image

Other attributes:
- `width` and `height`: size
