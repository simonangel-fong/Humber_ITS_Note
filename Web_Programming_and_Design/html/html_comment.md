# Comment 

HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

```html

<!-- this is a comment line. -->

```
- Notice that there is **an exclamation point (!)** in the start tag, but not in the end tag.

- Everything between the `<!--` and the `-->` will be hidden from the display.
