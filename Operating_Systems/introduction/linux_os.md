## Layers of Linux 三层(重点)

连接 OS[Components of OS](/ITC_5101_Operating_Systems/introduction/OS.md#components-of-an-operating-system-组成-重点)

1. kernel

   - invisible to the user
   - the heart or control section of the Unix/Linux system.

2. Shell

   - It acts as an **interface** between the user and the Unix system kernel.
   - also acts as a command line interpreter.

3. User

## Why LINUX is a preferred OS?

### Open Source

- Anyone can have **access to the source code** and make changes.
  LINUX is a FOSS(Free and Open Source software). 开源软件

- It comes under a special <u>licence known as GNU</u>(General Public Licence).有牌
  - Free Redistribution

### Linux is very secure (重点)

Only the admin user which is also known as a root user can install the applications in a Linux environment.

- Separation of duties 权限分离

  - sa: install software.
  - normal user: create, modify, delete files.

- Separation of directory：文件夹分离<br>
  - Root:By default, linux protect the root. Normal user can read but have not permission to write or execute.
  - home

和用户权限结合
