## File System

## File

- All files are **case sensitive**
    Linux is a case sensitive operating system. Files on Linux (or any Unix) are **case sensitive**.

    - Extension扩展名
    We can also give any extension to a file in Linux and it will be treated as a separate file even if we have the file with same name.
    扩展名与文件类型无关。

- Everything is a file
    A directory is a special kind of file, but it is still a (case sensitive!) file.
